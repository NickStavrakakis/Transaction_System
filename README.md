This project is about the implementation of a graph structure depicting transfers of money between different bank accounts.
The graph provides a mechanism that can help tracking the transactions, reading multi-triangular transfers, but also understanding client grouping. This system is supported by a structure implementation in the main memory in which the user can enter accounts and transactions, as well as identify situations that are likely generated by dynamic user behavior with the help of queries.
